The Connectivity, Information & Intelligence Lab (Ci2Lab), directed by Professor Reza Arghandeh, has a simple goal: explain infrastructure networks with data analytics. 
Our research focuses on the intersection of machine learning, causal inference, and complex networks. 
We endeavor to answer how infrastructure networks are interconnected, how the environment impacts them (and the other way around), and how they shape our lives.
